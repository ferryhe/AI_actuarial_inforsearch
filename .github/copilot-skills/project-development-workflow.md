# Project Development Workflow Skill

## Skill Identity
- **Name**: Project Development Workflow
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Type**: Development Process
- **Category**: Software Engineering

## Description
A comprehensive, battle-tested development workflow that ensures high-quality implementation through systematic planning, phased execution, automated testing, user validation, and complete documentation.

## When to Use This Skill
Trigger this workflow when:
- User requests: "按照标准流程开发...", "Use standard workflow for...", "Follow best practices to implement..."
- User mentions: "#dev-workflow", "#standard-process", "#best-practice"
- Project requires: Multiple phases, testing validation, or comprehensive documentation
- Features are: Medium to high complexity, user-facing, or mission-critical

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 0: Requirements Analysis & Planning
**Objective**: Understand requirements and create detailed implementation plan

**Steps**:
1. **Analyze Current State**
   - Review existing codebase structure
   - Identify affected modules and dependencies
   - Check for similar implementations or patterns
   - Document technical constraints

2. **Clarify Requirements**
   - Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous
   - Confirm user expectations and success criteria
   - Identify potential risks and challenges
   - Define scope boundaries (what's in, what's out)

3. **Create Implementation Plan**
   - Break down work into logical phases (usually 3-5 phases)
   - Define deliverables for each phase
   - Estimate effort for each phase
   - Identify dependencies between phases
   - Create task list with clear status tracking

4. **Design Technical Solution**
   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Plan data structures and interfaces
   - Design UI/UX if applicable
   - Make key technical decisions (document rationale)
   - Create architecture diagrams if needed

5. **Get User Approval**
   - Present plan document to user
   - Include: scope, phases, timeline, key decisions
   - Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding
   - Adjust plan based on user feedback

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive plan document (e.g., `FEATURE_NAME_PLAN.md`)

**Template**: See [Plan Template](#plan-template) section

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
**Objective**: Implement the planned functionality

**Steps**:
1. **Setup Task Tracking**
   - Use `manage_todo_list` tool to create tasks
   - Mark current task as "in-progress"
   - Keep todo list updated throughout implementation

2. **Implement in Logical Order**
   - Start with foundational components
   - Build incrementally (don't try to do everything at once)
   - Follow the phases defined in the plan
   - Keep changes focused and coherent

3. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Follow project's existing code style
   - Use meaningful variable/function names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Handle errors gracefully

4. **Incremental Commits** (Mental Checkpoints)
   - After completing each sub-task, verify it works
   - Mark task as complete in todo list
   - Document what was done before moving to next task

5. **Phase Completion Checklist**
   - [ ] All planned features implemented
   - [ ] Code follows project standards
   - [ ] No syntax errors (use `get_errors` tool)
   - [ ] Changes are coherent and complete
   - [ ] Ready for testing

**Progress Tracking**: Update todo list after each major milestone

---

### Phase 2: Automated Testing
**Objective**: Verify implementation through automated checks

**Steps**:
1. **Syntax & Static Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Use get_errors tool to check for:
   - Syntax errors
   - Type errors (if applicable)
   - Linting issues
   - Import errors
   ```

2. **Code Structure Verification**
   - Verify all planned files are modified/created
   - Check for missing imports or dependencies
   - Validate configuration files if changed
   - Review error handling paths

3. **Logic Validation**
   - Review critical code paths
   - Check edge cases are handled
   - Verify default values make sense
   - Ensure backward compatibility if needed

4. **Integration Check**
   - Verify new code integrates with existing code
   - Check API contracts are maintained
   - Validate data flow end-to-end
   - Ensure no breaking changes (unless intended)

**Deliverable**: Clean build with no errors

**Tools to Use**:
- `get_errors` - Check for compile/lint errors
- `grep_search` - Verify code patterns
- `read_file` - Review specific implementations

## Quality Gates

Each phase has quality gates that must be met before proceeding:

| Phase | Quality Gate | Tool/Method |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 0. Planning | User approval received | User confirmation |
| 1. Implementation | No syntax errors | `get_errors` |
| 2. Automated Testing | All checks pass | Tool validation |
| 3. Testing Prep | Guide is clear | Self-review |
| 4. User Testing | User confirms "测试通过" | User feedback |
| 5. Documentation | Report is complete | Checklist |
